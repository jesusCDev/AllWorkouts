# Media Controls Feature

## Overview
Added workout music control functionality that allows users to control their music (previous, play/pause, next) directly from the workout session screen without having to slide down the notification panel or leave the app.

## Feature Details

### User Experience
- **Clean Integration**: Media controls appear as a sleek control bar above the workout values
- **Toggle-able**: Can be enabled/disabled through the Settings screen
- **Non-intrusive**: Hidden by default, only shown when enabled by user
- **Position**: Located above the workout rep values for easy access during exercises

### Functionality
- **Previous Track**: Skip to previous song
- **Play/Pause**: Toggle music playback with visual feedback
- **Next Track**: Skip to next song
- **Universal Compatibility**: Works with most music apps (Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music, etc.)
- **Haptic Feedback**: Subtle vibration on button press for tactile confirmation

## Compatibility

## Performance Considerations
