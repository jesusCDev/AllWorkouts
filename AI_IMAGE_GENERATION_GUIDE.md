### AI Generation Tips

1. **Consistency**: Always include the master style prompt before each individual prompt
2. **Pose Clarity**: Focus on the peak moment of each exercise for maximum visual impact
3. **Vermilion Placement**: Strategically use the red accent on the primary working muscles
4. **Silhouette Quality**: Ensure the bone-white figure has clean, recognizable edges
5. **Background**: Keep deep charcoal black consistent across all images
6. **Grain Texture**: Add subtle film grain for vintage authenticity
7. **No Text**: Pure iconography only - no labels or text in images
8. **Square Format**: Maintain 1000x1000px for uniformity

### Color Testing
Test vermilion accent intensity at these values:
- Primary muscles: 100% `#FF432C`
- Secondary engagement: 60% `#99FF432C`
- Movement energy lines: 30% `#4DFF432C`
