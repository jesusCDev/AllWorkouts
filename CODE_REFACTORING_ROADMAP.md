# AllWorkouts - Code Refactoring & Optimization Roadmap

## 🎯 **Overview**
This document tracks our systematic refactoring of the AllWorkouts Android app to improve code quality, maintainability, and architecture. Each completed task will be marked and removed from this list.

---

## 📋 **Current Architecture Issues Identified**

### 1. **Activities Are Too Large (God Objects)**
- **MainActivity**: 250+ lines with mixed UI logic, data fetching, and business logic
- **SettingsActivity**: 200+ lines handling UI setup, validation, and data persistence
- **WorkoutSessionActivity**: All workout session logic crammed into single class
- **LogActivity**: Likely handling both UI and data processing

### 2. **Mixed Responsibilities**
- Activities handling business logic instead of just UI coordination
- No clear separation between UI management, data access, and business rules
- Complex view setup mixed with data operations

### 3. **Naming Conventions Fixed** ✅
- All underscore class names converted to PascalCase
- Method naming improved for consistency
- Package structure maintained but class names now follow Java standards

## 🔄 **Refactoring Tasks Queue**

### **Phase 1: Extract UI Management Logic**

#### **Task 1: Refactor MainActivity** ✅ **COMPLETED**
- [x] Extract `MainActivityUIManager` class
  - Handle workout chooser UI (open/close animations)
  - Manage view binding and styling
  - Handle UI state updates
- [x] Extract `WorkoutSelectionManager` class
  - Handle workout data fetching and filtering
  - Manage workout selection logic
  - Coordinate with preferences
- [x] Slim down MainActivity to just:
  - Activity lifecycle
  - UI manager coordination
  - Intent handling

#### **Task 2: Refactor SettingsActivity** 🔴 **PRIORITY HIGH**
- [ ] Extract `SettingsUIManager` class (different from current SettingsManager)
  - Handle all view binding and setup
  - Manage switch/button state updates
  - Handle animations and visual feedback
- [ ] Extract `SettingsDataManager` class  
  - Handle preferences reading/writing
  - Manage backup operations
  - Coordinate with WorkoutBasicsPrefsChecker
- [ ] Create `SettingsValidator` class
  - Validate user input
  - Handle business rules (like "at least one workout enabled")
- [ ] Slim SettingsActivity to coordination only

#### **Task 3: Refactor WorkoutSessionActivity** 🔴 **PRIORITY HIGH**
- [ ] Extract `WorkoutSessionUIManager` (separate from current one)
  - Handle view transitions (workout ↔ timer)
  - Manage rep display and progress indicators  
  - Handle media controls UI
- [ ] Extract `WorkoutSessionController` class
  - Handle workout flow logic
  - Coordinate timer and rep counting
  - Manage session state
- [ ] Extract `SessionDataManager` class
  - Handle session persistence
  - Manage workout completion data
  - Interface with database

#### **Task 4: Refactor LogActivity** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Analyze current LogActivity structure
- [ ] Extract UI management from data processing
- [ ] Separate chart generation from data fetching
- [ ] Create proper MVC structure

### **Phase 2: Improve Architecture Patterns**

#### **Task 5: Implement Proper MVC/MVP Pattern** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Define consistent interfaces between layers
- [ ] Create base classes for common patterns:
  - `BaseActivity` with common functionality
  - `BaseUIManager` for consistent UI management
  - `BaseDataManager` for data access patterns
- [ ] Implement dependency injection pattern where appropriate

#### **Task 6: Extract Common UI Components** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Create reusable custom views:
  - `WorkoutChooserView` (used in multiple places)
  - `ProgressIndicatorView` for workout sessions
  - `SettingsToggleView` for preference switches
- [ ] Implement proper styling inheritance
- [ ] Create view holder patterns where appropriate

#### **Task 7: Centralize Data Access** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Create `WorkoutRepository` pattern
  - Centralize all workout data access
  - Handle caching and data synchronization
  - Provide clean API for all activities
- [ ] Create `PreferencesRepository` 
  - Centralize all SharedPreferences access
  - Type-safe preference handling
  - Observable preference changes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for data operations

### **Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements**

#### **Task 8: Method Extraction & Single Responsibility** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Break down large methods (>20 lines) into smaller, focused methods
- [ ] Apply Single Responsibility Principle to all classes
- [ ] Remove code duplication through helper methods
- [ ] Improve method naming for clarity

#### **Task 9: Constants & Resource Management** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Move hardcoded strings to string resources
- [ ] Centralize dimension values in dimens.xml
- [ ] Create enum classes for app states and types
- [ ] Organize constant values by domain

#### **Task 10: Documentation & Comments** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Add JavaDoc to public methods and classes
- [ ] Document complex business logic
- [ ] Add inline comments for non-obvious code
- [ ] Create architectural decision records (ADR)

### **Phase 4: Performance & Modern Practices**

#### **Task 11: Memory & Performance Optimization** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Fix potential memory leaks (context references)
- [ ] Optimize view binding (use ViewBinding instead of findViewById)
- [ ] Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Optimize database queries and caching

#### **Task 12: Modern Android Practices** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Migration to AndroidX (if not already done)
- [ ] Implement ViewModel pattern for data persistence
- [ ] Add proper lifecycle awareness
- [ ] Implement proper Material Design components

## 📊 **Progress Tracking**

### **Completed Tasks** ✅
- [x] **Naming Convention Refactoring** - All underscore class names converted to PascalCase
- [x] **Notification System Fix** - Fixed crash and improved theming
- [x] **Mixed Variable Naming** - Fixed camelCase/underscore inconsistencies in WorkoutSessionActivity
- [x] **Phase 1, Task 1: MainActivity Refactoring** - Extracted UI and data managers, reduced MainActivity from 250+ lines to ~140 lines

### **Currently Working On** 🔄
- [ ] **Phase 1, Task 2**: SettingsActivity Refactoring

### **Next Up** ⏭️
- [ ] **Phase 1, Task 3**: WorkoutSessionActivity Refactoring

## 🎨 **Architecture Goal**

### **Target Structure Per Activity:**
```
Activity (Slim - 50-100 lines)
├── UI Manager (View handling, animations, styling)
├── Data Manager (Database, preferences, network)  
├── Business Logic Manager (Validation, rules, calculations)
└── Coordinator (Orchestrates between managers)
```

### **Benefits of This Approach:**
1. **Testability** - Each manager can be unit tested independently
2. **Maintainability** - Changes are isolated to specific concerns
3. **Readability** - Code purpose is clear from class names
4. **Reusability** - Managers can be shared between activities
5. **Debugging** - Issues are easier to trace and fix

## 📝 **Notes**
- **Mark completed tasks with** ✅ **and remove from the queue**
- **Update progress regularly to track momentum**
- **Each task should have clear acceptance criteria**
- **Focus on one phase at a time to maintain code stability**
- **Test thoroughly after each major refactor**
