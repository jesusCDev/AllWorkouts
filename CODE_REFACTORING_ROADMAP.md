# AllWorkouts - Code Refactoring & Optimization Roadmap

## 🎯 **Overview**
This document tracks our systematic refactoring of the AllWorkouts Android app to improve code quality, maintainability, and architecture. Each completed task will be marked and removed from this list.

---

## 📋 **Current Architecture Issues Identified**

### 1. **Activities Are Too Large (God Objects)**
- **MainActivity**: 250+ lines with mixed UI logic, data fetching, and business logic
- **SettingsActivity**: 200+ lines handling UI setup, validation, and data persistence
- **WorkoutSessionActivity**: All workout session logic crammed into single class
- **LogActivity**: Likely handling both UI and data processing

### 2. **Mixed Responsibilities**
- Activities handling business logic instead of just UI coordination
- No clear separation between UI management, data access, and business rules
- Complex view setup mixed with data operations

### 3. **Naming Conventions Fixed** ✅
- All underscore class names converted to PascalCase
- Method naming improved for consistency
- Package structure maintained but class names now follow Java standards

  - `BaseController` for business logic coordination
- [x] Implement dependency injection pattern where appropriate
  - Created ServiceLocator for simple dependency injection
  - All managers now use consistent callback and lifecycle patterns

#### **Task 6: Extract Common UI Components** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Create reusable custom views:
  - `WorkoutChooserView` (used in multiple places)
  - `ProgressIndicatorView` for workout sessions
  - `SettingsToggleView` for preference switches
- [ ] Implement proper styling inheritance
- [ ] Create view holder patterns where appropriate

#### **Task 7: Centralize Data Access** 🟡 **PRIORITY MEDIUM**
- [ ] Create `WorkoutRepository` pattern
  - Centralize all workout data access
  - Handle caching and data synchronization
  - Provide clean API for all activities
- [ ] Create `PreferencesRepository` 
  - Centralize all SharedPreferences access
  - Type-safe preference handling
  - Observable preference changes
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for data operations

### **Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements**

#### **Task 8: Method Extraction & Single Responsibility** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Break down large methods (>20 lines) into smaller, focused methods
- [ ] Apply Single Responsibility Principle to all classes
- [ ] Remove code duplication through helper methods
- [ ] Improve method naming for clarity

#### **Task 9: Constants & Resource Management** 🟢 **PRIORITY LOW**
- [ ] Move hardcoded strings to string resources

## 🎨 **Architecture Goal**

### **Target Structure Per Activity:**
```
Activity (Slim - 50-100 lines)
├── UI Manager (View handling, animations, styling)
├── Data Manager (Database, preferences, network)  
├── Business Logic Manager (Validation, rules, calculations)
└── Coordinator (Orchestrates between managers)
```

### **Benefits of This Approach:**
1. **Testability** - Each manager can be unit tested independently
2. **Maintainability** - Changes are isolated to specific concerns
3. **Readability** - Code purpose is clear from class names
4. **Reusability** - Managers can be shared between activities
5. **Debugging** - Issues are easier to trace and fix

## 📝 **Notes**
- **Mark completed tasks with** ✅ **and remove from the queue**
- **Update progress regularly to track momentum**
- **Each task should have clear acceptance criteria**
- **Focus on one phase at a time to maintain code stability**
- **Test thoroughly after each major refactor**
